# 🚀 Backend Developer Journey – From Zero to Production

Welcome to my hands-on learning journey towards becoming a **skilled backend developer**. This repository documents everything — from mastering **JavaScript fundamentals** to building **scalable, secure, and production-ready backend applications** using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, and Next.js**.

This repo is structured in phases, simulating the real-world learning curve. Each folder contains source code, explanations, and implementation of key backend concepts — from beginner to advanced level.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- 📖 Daily learning log and code practice.
- 🛠️ Build a strong backend foundation with real-world problems.
- 📦 Maintain reusable snippets for future backend projects.
- 🌐 Eventually transition into full-stack projects using **Next.js**.
